## Introduction
  - In this project, I wrote a program to simulate a set of flash cards through the command line!  A user is able to see the questions, 
     take guesses, and see a final score at the end of the round.
## How To Use
To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone git@github.com:Jedeo/flashcards-project.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd flashcard-project 


```

## Features
  More practice fuctionality  so that a score of less than 90% will require the user to go through the entire dataset again.
